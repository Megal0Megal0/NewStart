**Cybernetics** - Most cybernetics require **[[Actions\|AP]]** to use/activate and also need batteries. How often these batteries need to be replaced is shown by the [[Charge\|Charge]] rule. 

The max number of cybernetics installed is dictated by the Grade of the user's [[CMO\|CMO]], however normally no two cybernetics can be installed in the same place, example: *Frog Legs* and *Sprinters* cannot be used together as they both replace legs.

Charge 3 turns.

**Ghostveil Matrix** 1AP (1 CS)
Description: This implant bends light around the user, rendering them nearly invisible to the naked eye. Unlike true invisibility, it relies on active light distortion, meaning rapid movement or environmental factors (such as rain or dust) can slightly reveal the user’s outline.  
Rules:  
Charge 2 minutes.

**Specter Core** Free (1 CS)
Description: A high-grade cloaking system that completely erases the user from both visual and digital detection. Unlike standard light-bending tech, this implant hides heat signatures, dampens sound, and prevents radar tracking, making the user truly undetectable when active.  
Rules:  
Charge 3 turns.

**Omnisight Optics** Free (1 CS)
Description: A neural-augmented ocular system that allows the user to see living organisms through solid objects up to 1 meter thick. The vision mode highlights biometric heat signatures and motion, making it perfect for tracking enemies, locating hostages, or avoiding ambushes.  
Rules:  
Charge 10 minutes.

**Deadeye Cortex** Free (2 CS)
Description: A direct neural implant that enhances hand-eye coordination, reflexes, and ballistic trajectory calculations. When active, it adjusts the user's aim in real time, accounting for movement, gravity, and wind resistance, effectively turning any shot into a perfect one.  
Rules:  
Steady aim - when shooting range weapon you have +4 to aim rolls.
Charge 1 use.

**Quadrasynth Arms** N/A (1 CS)
Description: This implant enhances the nervous system and muscular structure to support two additional cybernetic arms. These arms function as seamlessly as natural limbs, allowing to benefit from two different cybernetic arms without a lengthy.

**Tactical Uplink** 1AP per Drone used (2 CS)
Description: A neural interface implant that allows the user to wirelessly control, and pilot any compatible drone within range that they have connected with. Whether it’s a recon scout, combat drone, or an industrial bot, the implant gives direct first-person control via a neural link.  
Rules:  
Charge 1 hours.

**OmniSpectre Optics** Free (1 CS)
Description: Advanced cybernetic lenses that scan and analyze any technology, cybernetics, or machinery in real-time. Displays detailed information and schematics of the analyzed object on the user’s HUD.  
Rules: 
Charge 2 uses.

**EchoTrace Vision** Free (1 CS)
Description: This implant scans an environment and reconstructs recent movements, interactions, and disturbances, allowing the user to "see" what happened moments ago. Detects footprints, tampered devices, and even the heat residue of a person who was recently there.  
Rules:  
Charge 5 minutes.

**Vitalis Nano-Surge** Free (2 CS)
Description: A self-repair implant that deploys microscopic nanobots into the bloodstream. When activated, they rapidly seal wounds, repair tissue, and eliminate toxins, providing fast but temporary regeneration.  
Rules:  
Repair wounds overtime - heals you 2hp per turn starting from the start of your next turn
Charge 2 turns.

**Hemolock Dispenser** Automatic (1 CS)
Description: A biofoam injection system integrated into the user’s body. Upon activation, it releases a quick-expanding medical foam that immediately seals deep wounds, preventing excessive blood loss, and stabilizes the user until further medical treatment is available.  
Rules:  
Stops bleeding
Charge 1 uses.

**Apex Reflex Module** Free (1 CS)
Description: A combat AI implant that uploads hand-to-hand combat techniques directly into the user’s motor cortex.
