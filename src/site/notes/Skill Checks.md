## Challenges

If players encounter a situation where the chance of failure is realistic they will roll **2d6** and add any negative or positive [[Modifiers\|modifiers]] that apply. The player succeeds if his roll after calculations is equal to or grater than a challenge rating decided by the GM. A general representation of what challenge ratings different obstacles can have:

- incredibly simple everyday tasks like walking and opening doors do not require a roll

- 3-5, A fairly simple task that requires little focus: shattering a window, untangling a simple knot, climbing over a tall fence

- 6-9, A difficult test that requires focus: climbing a ladder very quickly, steering a ship through a tight tunnel, hiding in plain sight from a pursuit

- 10-12, A challenge considered difficult even by expert, requires total focus and luck: jumping from one ship to another during high speed flight, getting classified information from an agent during casual conversation, beating a world record in an arcade game

## Attack Rolls

When attacking a Player will roll either a 1d6 or a 2d6 depending on a weapon, the effects of the number rolled (+modifiers) is shown in a specific chart attached to every weapon. 

Unarmed strikes require a 1d6 roll and hit on anything above a 2 dealing 1 damage.
