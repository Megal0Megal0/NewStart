**CMO - Cybernetics Module Operator** - is an essential implant required for any advanced cybernetics, it connects directly to the brain allowing for seamless integration of cybernetics and their natural use. In appearance a standard CMO is simply a rectangle metal plate with smooth edges sticking out of the back of a person's neck. 
Several ports are set into the plate allowing for wired connection to some devices, next to the ports is a small round opening covered by a small door that opens when pressed, if there are spent batteries in it's system a CMO will eject them when the door is opened, in their place new ones can be inserted to be stored internally.

Every Player starts with a Grade 1 CMO that allows for 6 Cyber Slots, each cybernetic enchantment takes at least 1 Cyber Slot. Grade 1 CMO has a battery storage of 6.
