## Fights

A fight begins when either players or npcs begin a conflict by attacking.

Once the first attack is concluded everyone taking part in the battle rolls a 2d6, (if npc are similar when it comes to skill and equipment they roll collectively if not separately). The Players and their enemies take turns in battle according to the number they rolled in a descending order. Any ties among players are resolved however they want. If a Player ties with an enemy they go first but the enemy has a +2 modifier to attacks against that player.

### Actions

A player possesses 2 Action Points (AP), attacks, additional movement, skill checks and other actions require 1 AP or more with the exclusion of some special abilities, items etc. that can be activated/used at no cost. 

A player may move 4 meters without using AP.

Other actions include:

Sprint - 1 AP (run additional 4m)
Dodge - 2 AP (-2 to any attacks made against player)
Block - 2 AP (-2 to damage from melee attacks)
Defend - 2AP (Receive any attacks instead of a chosen target within 2m of you)
Hide - 1AP (Hide if cover is available, you may not hide if within sight of an enemy)
Aim - 2AP (+2 to the first ranged attack you make in your next turn)
